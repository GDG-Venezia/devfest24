    title: "LLM pipelines built for critical performances"
    abstract: "When designing LLM-based applications, itâ€™s tempting to go with the best-in-class of any component in the content generation pipeline. Yet, especially in consumer use cases, we must evaluate trade-offs to balance content quality and performances, as they both severely impact UX and one cannot compensate the other.
<br><br>
Picking from our own experience building a consumer app serving users real-time content generated on the fly with a complex LLM pipeline, we will explore lessons learnt, tips and tricks to find the sweet spot between these two contrasting forces."
