    title: "A Guide To CSS Layouts"
    abstract: "This talk aims to cover the best layouts to use according to their designated purposes.<br><br>
CSS provides certain display properties for layout purposes and, while some may argue that a particular layout is better than another, all every layout choice is suited for a particular design need.<br><br>
Whether you'd go down with the CSS Grid ship or you're a staunch Flexbox supporter, we'll cover all possible layout choices (yes, even table). We'll also discuss best layout practices for responsive and accessible design."
