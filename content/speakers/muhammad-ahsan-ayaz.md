    title: "What If Your Content Could Talk? RAG Meets Google Gemini for AI-Driven Engagement and Sales"
    abstract: "What if your content could talk back? In this talk, we explore how AI can transform static content into interactive conversations that engage users and drive business results. Using Google Gemini and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), I built a custom AI assistant for my Angular Cookbook website, turning a simple website and a traditional book into an intelligent, interactive resource.
<br><br>
Attendees will discover how Google Gemini powers real-time user queries, delivering not only relevant information but also links to demos and GitHub repositories, all while enhancing user experience and engagement. We’ll dive into the tech stack—Google Gemini, LLAMA Index, RAG, and Python—that made this AI assistant possible, along with a live demo showcasing how the assistant works in action.
<br><br>
Whether you're a developer, content creator, or business owner, this talk will show you how AI can turn your content into a conversation, ultimately boosting user engagement and unlocking new sales potential.
<br><br>
Join me to learn how you can leverage AI to bring your content to life!"
